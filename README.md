# Enter the Gungeon: Steam Deck Letterboxing Patch
Removes the black bars when playing Enter the Gungeon on a Steam Deck.

This patch allows the game to be played at the full 16:10 (8:5) aspect ratio without stretching the pixels, hiding the art, or causing bugs with the camera and gameplay.

Works with Enter the Gungeon version 2.1.9.

## Directions: 
- Switch to Desktop mode.
- Download or copy the gungeon-steamdeck-patch.sh file to the "Enter the Gungeon" root directory (Ex: /steamapps/common/Enter the Gungeon/).
- Run the script in a terminal window `sh gungeon-steamdeck-patch.sh`.
